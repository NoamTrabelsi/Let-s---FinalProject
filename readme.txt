The "Let’s" app helps solo travelers find partners for their next trip based on preferences and lifestyle.

Using a Vector Similarity-based matching algorithm, users can find suitable partners. They can choose a destination and dates, see others who want to visit the same place at the same time, and assess compatibility. The system allows viewing detailed profiles and reading user reviews, enhancing the sense of security. Additionally, users can send messages to potential partners and get to know them better before the trip.

Initial findings show users experience increased security and high satisfaction from finding suitable travel partners. The ability to customize searches and receive feedback is highly valued.

Developed using MERN stack technology, the project offers flexibility for expansion. In the future, the app can be extended to find partners not only for trips but also for daily activities such as going to the cinema, sports, and events, increasing the target audience and adding significant value.
